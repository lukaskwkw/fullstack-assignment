# Canvas-2d-library

Canvas 2d library with support of physic (gravity, spring, orbiting). This library is a ongoing result of "Coding Math" youtube series. Project is based on my [boirelplate](https://github.com/lukaskwkw/wrepp-boilerplate/) with addition of typescript support

## Current status:

- Support of plane boundaries crossing: (bouncingBoundires, moveToOtherSide, emmitter, removeDeadParticles).
- Basic particle physics (gravity, spring, orbiting).
- Particle basic movements, acceleration, rotation.
- Reimplemation of default bezier functions - quadric, bezier (additional - multiquadric), with new functions you can iterate through steps (move objects along the bezier line)
- Support many customable rendeners with animations i.e. pulse, alpha, lissajous curves
- Particles Drag and drop support

## Prerequisites:

[NodeJS v12.2.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Running

Start development server:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

Open webrowser at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)

Start production server:

```sh
npm run start
```

with pre-build

```sh
npm run build-and-run
```

Open webrowser at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

## Building

client

```sh
npm run build-client
```

server

```sh
npm run build-server
```

## To-do:

- Particle collision support
- Add docker support
